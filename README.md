## Inspiration
We were thinking of a way to incorporate our skills in python and data science to create an awesome application that would be fun in addition to serving a practical use. We decided to create Stock Savant, which is a culmination of our skills we have learned this far.
## What it does
Our application allows the user to input a stock ticker, and in return they receive a recommendation on whether it would be a good buy based on different indicators that we believe tell the whole story of a stock
## How we built it
For the backend, we used the Python libraries yFinance, Pytorch, flask, and pandas, numpy, NewsAPI, Reddit API. For the frontend, we used vanilla html, css, and javascript (boring!)
## Challenges we ran into
It took us a while to land on a solid stock market library to be able to access past stock performance, in addition to wasting countless hours of trying to run an open source large language model.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating our first backend system for a website and creating our first project that utilizes machine learning. Making algorithms that predict the future is always a heavy task, but we believe it payed off, as the final product is something we are proud of.
## What we learned
We learned tons about machine learning, flask, web development, and quantitative finance. We learned that a big part of hackathons is being able to work well with your teammates, because we all know once it gets late enough, things can start to get out of hand.
## What's next for Stock Savant
We are hoping to deploy the app online so anyone can use it for any device. This will hopefully be done by the end of the hackathon. We also want to add more datapoints for a more accurate prediction of the stock.

We wanted to thank Goldman Sachs for the opportunity to create such a cool project, and HackUTD for putting everything together!
